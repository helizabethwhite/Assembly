Computer Project #4 -- Sequential Circuits

a) Give your name, MSU PID and sequence derived from your MSU PID.

  Name: Hannah White

  MSU PID: A45213885

  Derived sequence: A->4->5->2->1->3->8
 

b) Complete the following truth tables to describe the Boolean functions which
form the basis for your circuits.  For each function, replace the hyphens with
the appropriate entry (0, 1 or d), where 'd' represents the "don't care"
condition.

c) Complete the following Karnaugh maps for your Boolean functions.  For each
input combination, replace the hyphen with the appropriate entry (0, 1 or d).

d) Give the minimized (simplified) expression for each of the Boolean
functions.
 
   W(w,x,y,z) =
 
   X(w,x,y,z) =
 
   Y(w,x,y,z) =
 
   Z(w,x,y,z) =
